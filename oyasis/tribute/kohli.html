        <h2>Career</h2><br>
        <div id="text">
            Virat Kohli first came into the limelight in 2008, when he led the Indian U-19 cricket team to victory in
            2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup He soon made his debut for the Indian team in August 2008.
            during a ODI match against in Sri Lanka.
            Virat also became one of the valuable Indian captain in Test cricket with 27 test wins, 12 overseas test
            wins and highest winning percentage as captain in both Tests and ODIs.
            Kohli was ranked eighth in ESPN's list of world's most famous sportspeople in 2016.
            Virat is the only current player to have a stand named after him in Delhi Firoz Shah Kotla stadium to honour
            his immaculate contributions to Indian cricket.
            When West Delhi Cricket Academy was created in 1998, Kohli was part of its first batch and received training
            under Rajkumar Sharma.<br><br>

            Kohli made his cricket debut in October 2002 with the Delhi Under-15 team in the 2002-03 Polly Umrigar
            Trophy and lead the team for the next trophy. He was later selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the
            2003-04 Vijay Merchant Trophy where he finished as the highest run-scorer.<br><br>

            At the age of 18, Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu wherein he scored 10 runs.
            In July 2006, he made his debut in the Under-19 team during India's tour of England. India won both ODI and
            Test series. Kohli made his T20 debut next year and emerged as the highest run-scorer in the Inter-State T20
            Championship with 179 runs.<br><br>

            The year 2008 was a life-changing year for Kohli. First, he captained the Under-19 Cricket World Cup-winning
            team. Second, he was bought by RCB for $30,000 on a youth contract for IPL. Third, he made his international
            debut.<br><br>

            After recovering from a minor injury, Kohli replaced Gambhir for the tri-series in Sri Lanka and batter at
            no. 4 in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy as Yuvraj Singh was recovering from an injury.
            For the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in 2010, Tendulkar was rested, thereby enabling Kohli to
            play in each match. Due to his phenomenal performance in Bangladesh, he was praised by the then captain MS
            Dhoni.
            <br><br>
            Kohli was part of the World Cup-winning team in 2011 and became the first Indian batsman to score a century
            on World Cup debut.

            Kohli made his Test debut against West Indies at Kingston and performed poorly in the series, amassing just
            76 runs in five innings. In 2015, he became the first Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in
            a World Cup match.<br><br>

            During South Africa's tour of India, he became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I
            cricket, achieving the feat in his 27th innings.

            During the ODI tour of Australia, Kohli emerged as the fastest batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run
            mark in ODIs, and the fastest to score 25 centuries.
            <br><br>
            During the 3 match Test series against Sri Lanka at home in 2017, he became the first batsman to score six
            double hundreds as a captain. That year, he scored a total of 2818 international runs, the third-highest by
            an Indian in a calendar year and highest ever by an Indian player.

            In August 2018, he ranked no. 1 in the ICC Test rankings. With this, he became the seventh Indian batter to
            achieve this milestone. He became the first Indian, first captain and tenth overall to hit three successive
            centuries in ODIs in October 2018.
